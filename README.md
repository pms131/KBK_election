# Not completed yet.

# The new
- /config/start_kbkd.sh
- /config/stop_kbkd.sh

# How to use? 
- As you see, the shell command is a simple yet. It is based on regtest in bitcoind. So this shell just use it.

- Note that you should make a new diretory in this shell, default is 'uki' Or just use ~/.bitcoin/. But you have to delete 'datadir' tag!!

# Plan to do 

- Making a folder in shell.

- And kind of configuration things.

# NOTICE

- Out project is based on bitcoin.So The first you have to do is install bitcoin. I hope you make it. Thank you
